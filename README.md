# Anz eGate

## Usage



## Testing

Anz seem to have removed their public testing profile, I've instead set the fixtures to come from environment variables

    export ANZ_MERCHANT=TESTyoumerchantname
    export ANZ_CODE=youroperatorcode

To set up your testing environment you will need to log in as the _Administrator_ using your merchantid prefixed by test. The password will be the same as your production account.
